# Web-Technology-Project
This is my school project for the course Web-Technologies-1 in the program Computer Software and Database Development. The technologies used is HTML and CSS (Basic CSS)

I was supposed to create an educational website with my group mates, we worked on the requirements and created wireframes. After getting wireframes approved by the professor we started working on the UI/UX designs. We made all the design work on Adobe XD.
After the presenting our Designs and getting approval from the professor we started implementing the designing concepts and created web pages.

I thank my professor and my team mates for supporting me and guiding me.
