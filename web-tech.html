                    <h3 class="header-style">About Program</h3>
                    <p class="text mt-10">The Computer Software & Database Development Ontario College Graduate Certificate Program offers students the opportunity to study the most current trends in website development, computer programming, database design and development,
                        mobile development, and web technologies. This intensive two-year course includes an introduction to computing and web trends, and rapidly familiarizes students with current development tools to culminate in a work-term for eligible
                        students. Major coursework provides a hands-on environment allowing students to evaluate, design, and implement software applications for the three-tier client, server, and database environment. In the final academic term, students
                        also explore Emerging Technologies that are becoming relevant in their field.</p>

                    <p class="text mt-10">Students study Microsoft C# and Oracle Java programming languages as well as the Oracle and IBM DB2 databases. Graduates have the ability to use problem solving and critical thinking skills to analyze business and industry requirements
                        and design, develop and implement real life database-driven enterprise web applications. </p>

                    <p class="text mt-10">For those studying in Sarnia, students are offered extra-curricular experiences through The Cube, Lambton’s entrepreneurship hub, and through Applied Research & Innovation—giving students unique opportunities to build new technologies
                        and follow their own dreams. Applied Research opportunities are limited for students studying at Lambton in Toronto. </p>

                    <p class="text mt-10">CSAC has a co-op component where students with a GPA of 2.8 or greater may have an opportunity to enhance their classroom learning in a real world industry environment. Graduates are prepared for entry-level careers in the information
                        technology field across Canada.</p>
